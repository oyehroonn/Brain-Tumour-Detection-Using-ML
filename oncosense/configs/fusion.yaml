# EGU-Fusion++ Configuration for OncoSense

# Entropy-Guided Uncertainty Fusion
egu_fusion:
  # Alpha parameter for uncertainty weighting
  # Higher alpha = more aggressive downweighting of uncertain models
  alpha: 1.0
  
  # Uncertainty metric to use: "entropy" or "variance"
  uncertainty_metric: "entropy"
  
  # Temperature for softmax fusion weights
  fusion_temperature: 1.0

# Abstention thresholds
abstention:
  # Abstain if max probability below this threshold
  max_prob_threshold: 0.6
  
  # Abstain if entropy above this threshold
  entropy_threshold: 1.2
  
  # Abstain if all models disagree (max disagreement)
  disagreement_threshold: 0.8
  
  # Use both conditions (AND) or either (OR)
  mode: "or"  # Abstain if either condition met

# Calibration settings
calibration:
  method: "temperature_scaling"
  optimize_metric: "nll"
  temperature_init: 1.5
  temperature_bounds: [0.1, 10.0]

# Risk-coverage evaluation
risk_coverage:
  # Coverage thresholds to evaluate
  coverage_points: [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.95, 1.0]
  
  # Risk metric: "error_rate" or "brier"
  risk_metric: "error_rate"
